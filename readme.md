# Unit 1 Team Project: eCommerce Site

### Getting Started

You will be working with a team of three or four people to create a mockup of an eCommerce site. Together, you will create the basic structure of the site which includes three pages:

1. [Homepage](./mockups/homepage.png)
1. [Products](./mockups/products.png)
1. [Checkout](./mockups/checkout.png)

##### After being assigned teams, do the following:

1. Have one member of your team create a new Project on Tracker.
  1. Click the settings button (it looks like a little gear) and go to the Members tab.
  1. Add the members of your team to the project.
  1. Click the Import tab and upload the [Tracker CSV](./pivotal/pivotal-stories.csv).
1. Have one member of your team create a new repository on Github for your project.
  1. Add the members of your team to the repository.
  1. As a team, discuss your workflow. Will you require PRs? Different branches?
1. As a team, choose what Products you'd like to be "selling" and pick a [Bootstrap Theme](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/) you'd like to use.
1. As a team, look through the various wireframes and talk about how the page might be structured. Consider sharing notes through Google Docs or a tool like [Bounce](http://www.bounceapp.com/).
1. Make a plan and split up the work by assigning individual people to tasks; but, work together to get everything done!

Your instructors will share more on the schedule and any deadlines. Have fun!
